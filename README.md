# Can Protein Structure Prediction Methods Capture Alternative Conformations of Membrane Proteins?

In this study, we benchmarked 12 representative protein structure methods on alternative conformation prediction in a curated dataset that consists of Inward-facing and Outward-facing states of Membrane Proteins (IOMemP) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). 
The methods were benchmarked using unified input multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). 
Additionally, we tested 2 AlphaFold-based methods that manipulate MSAs to predict alternative conformations. 
Our dataset IOMemP and benchmark results could promote the development of alternative conformation prediction.
